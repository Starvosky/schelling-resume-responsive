            <h3>Volunteer Experiance</h3>

            <h3>Toy's For Tots</h3>
            <p>I have been volunteering for Toy's for Tots for a couple years now. Not all in a row but I've dedicated a few winters to the Marine Corp sponsered Program. I started at a very young age with my dad who ran the color gaurd at the time and subsequently helped run Toy's for Tots. Tasks that I'd be self assigned could be split into three catagories. Packing is where the toys coming into the warehouse would be split into different sections based on gender, the type of toy it was, and how large it was. Then from there the toys would be packed into a box with an assortment from one genders based toys and then sent up to delivery. Delivery is as simple as it sounds. Toys that are packed into boxes are either carted or carried to the distrubation tables where they'll be unpacked between all the various distribution tables to be handed out. Then at Distribution you'd sit at one of the table and ensure that the parents don't take more toys then they are assigned and to help them to select and cart their toys. </p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>

        <div class="column">

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>In my most recent time my schooling, work, and social activities are preventing me from my usual intake of digital media in the form of video games but typically I'm an avid video gamer. I'll play various kinds of games ranging from PC, mobile phone, or Console games. I typically enjoy Grand Strategy or Tactical Shooters like Stellaris and Rainbow 6 Siege. In the physical form of gaming I typically have Sunday nights reserved at my church to play board games like Bang!, Monopoly, Catan, or Apples to Apples or I'll play Dungeons and Dragons where I'll typically be a Dungeon Master. </p>
